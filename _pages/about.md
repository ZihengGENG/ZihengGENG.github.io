I am a PhD student in the Department of Civil & Architectural Engineering at **University of Miami**. I'm being supervised by [**Dr. Minghui Cheng**](https://fsminghuic.wixsite.com/minghuicheng) to develop **digital twins for infrastructure systems**.

Before I joined U, I obtained my BEng and MEng degrees at **Hunan University**. I am fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Chao Zhang**](https://chaozhanghnu.github.io/) to integrate multi-source information for **intelligent detection of ground properties during earth pressure balance shields (EPBS) tunnelling process**.

Feel free to discuss research with me via [**ziheng.geng@miami.edu**](mailto:ziheng.geng@miami.edu)/[**gengziheng@hnu.edu.cn**](mailto:gengziheng@hnu.edu.cn).
