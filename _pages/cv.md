Research Experience
======
- **Scheduling Software for Deep Foundation Pit Engineering**

    The software integrates **GIS** and **BIM** to construct the digital foundation pit engineering scene. **A-star algorithm** is utilized to plan the path for the excavators within the 3D foundation pit. The visualization is implemented with the aid of **Unity 3D**.

- **A Kriging-Random Forest Hybrid Model (KRF)**

    The KRF model synergizes **prior and real-time information** to predict the ground properties. **Prior information** incorporates the **inherent spatial correlation** of ground properties within a given region. **Real-time information** refers to the **current operating parameters**, reflecting real-time shield–ground interactions. These two predictions are integrated according to their **uncertainties**, ensuring the prediction of KRF with minimum uncertainty.

- **Vibration Monitoring of the Shield Machine**

    A **vibration monitoring system** including seven accelerometers is designed and implemented in the Changsha Metro Line 1 North Extension. It provides a comprehensive vibration dataset of an EPB shield machine excavating through various rock types. Based on vibration analysis, **two classification charts** are developed for **full-face rock type detection** and **ground composition detection**, respectively. The proposed charts yield **error-free predictions** for all the 1752 recorded points in the project.
